```{python}

import us #we're importing the necessary library
import pandas as pd

c = us.states.STATES  #we're saving as c a list of states

print (c)

print([x.name for x in c]) #list became string

states_lowercase= [x.name for x in c]
states.to_csv('states_lowercase.csv', sep= ',')

for i in range(len(states_lowercase)):

  states_lowercase[i] = states_lowercase[i].upper() #our list became uppercase

first = pd.DataFrame([states_lowercase]) 
states = first.transpose() #actually there are another simple way, without transpose, but i can't now
states.to_csv('states_uppercase.csv', sep= ',')
