## exercise 1:

-   ***Consider a FizzBuzz problem. The program should write numbers from 1 to 100, separated by a newline, but multiples of 3 and of 5 should be replaced with "Fizz" and "Buzz" respectively. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz". Here are some solutions, which are not readable:***

```{python}

 

  
for i in range (1,100):
  if (i % 15) == 0:           #if both FizzBuzz 
    print ("FizzBuzz")
  elif (i % 3) == 0:          # if i is a multiple of 3 type Fizz  
    print ("Fizz")           
  elif (i % 5) == 0:          #if i is a multiple of 5 type Buzz
    print("Buzz")            
  else: 
    print(i)                  #else number 
  
```

## exercise 2

a.  ***Write a function which takes n (float or integer) as a parameter and returns the largest Fibonacci number smaller than n. The function should be documented, with type hints, and appropriate comments.***

```{python}

def fibonacci (n): 
  if n==0 or n==1:
    result = 1
  else: 
    result= fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)
  return result 



def fibonacci_bigger_smaller (n,i=1):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return print("doesn't exist a fibonacci number smaller than", n) 
  elif fibonacci(i) >= n :  #if this one is bigger, the previous one was smaller
    return fibonacci (i-1)
  while True:        #this function allows us to check every fobinacci number from 1 to n
    fibonacci(i) < n 
    return fibonacci_bigger_smaller (n,i=i+1) 
    
print(fibonacci_bigger_smaller(90))
```


b. ***Write a function which reverses digits in an integer number (for example 7245 -> 5427). The function should be documented, with type hints, and appropriate comments.***

```{python}
 
def rev(n,reverse=0):
  while (n>0):                #while there are number 
    N_D = n % 10              #it means take the last number (New Digits)
    reverse= reverse*10 + N_D #ad add in the reverse number (set to zero at the biginning)
    n= n//10                  #remove the last digits of the number
  return (reverse)


rev(7245)
    
```
